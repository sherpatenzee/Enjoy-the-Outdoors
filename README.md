Capstone 2 ---  week 7


This website has 3 main pages and an optional sign up form page. 

Home page has a nav bar to navigate around the other pages and a anchor tag that links to a sign up form page. There is some text in the center and for the background i used a video of zion national park to make it look interactive and engaging to users. All the styles use bootstrap.

National parks page displays the list of parks by filtering through location or park type. I have four select dropdowns in html and have probamatically loaded them through javascript. The options loop over the array and displays the list the user selects. The final display uses a card class and shows the name and details of each park.

Mountain page has a very simple mountain background also with the same nav bar. This page is rather simple and displays the details of mountains selected by the user along with an image of the mountain. This page also uses a bootstrap dropdown for better styling. 

Images were provided in the zip file along with the data. I also managed to have the data files seperate to the main javascript files and linked them in HTML. 

Sign up page simply uses a sign up form with some inputs for name email and a button. The form uses bootstrap as well.
